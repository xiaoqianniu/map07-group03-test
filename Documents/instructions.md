PWA - Course Project Description and Requirements.

The project consists of 2 parts which are going to follow the course structure. The first part is to develop a simple website/app of your choice and the second part will be to convert it into a PWA version connected to firebase. You can build a simple app with Html, CSS, and Javascript where the minimum requirement is to have login/registration, a list of objects on the home page, and a feature of your choice (e.g. search functionality, shopping cart without payment system, since it requires an API connection and its an effort equivalent for final project) Since we have 2 consecutive courses adding up to a month and teams of 3, I suggest you do your sprints and scrum master rotation on a weekly basis. The scrum master will be responsible for setting up a Trello board for the project, creating/backlogging the tasks, setting up scrum meetings, and preparing a scrum report at the end of the week. The scrum report can be a free format or template of your choice but the content should consist of the tasks per week distribution per team member, blockings if any, and it's an optional part - effort in hours. The conclusion of the project will be followed by a short (15 min/each ) demonstration and presentation. Make sure you create and use your branches at GitHub and share your links with me in the Teams Groups we created.
